Lists all ACF/ACF PRO variables of created fields so that you can simply copy-and-paste into your theme template files. 

== Description == 

Finally being able to copy all ACF field variables is here!!!

**Supports ACF PRO!**

This plugin was build for the awesomeness of the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/ "Advanced custom fields | ACF") plugin created by Elliot Condon, so that referencing custom fields is fast and makes life easier for developers. 

You are now able to get a complete list of fields that you've created, make adjustments with the available options, and simply copy-and-paste them right into your theme template. No more switching back-and-forth screens in order to copy-and-paste field names into your file. whew!

== Features ==

- Easily switch from field names to field IDs.
- Easily choose between the_field() or get_field() functions to use.
- Show all fields-group with fields OR just the fields created within the current field group section.
- Show Example field code and decriptions.
- Works great with ACF PRO
